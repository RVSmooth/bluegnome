#+title: AllBlue

Images based on universal-blue's images, intended for experiment and personal use.
Currently I build GNOME (bluegnome) based on ublue's bluefin and QTile (bluetile) based on ublue's main image.

* Installation

  Warning: This is an experimental feature. Try at your own discretion.
  You can rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build by following these steps:

  - First, rebase to the unsigned image to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/rvsmooth/$IMAGE_NAME:latest
  #+END_SRC

  - Reboot to complete the rebase:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  systemctl reboot
  #+END_SRC

  - Then, rebase to the signed image:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/rvsmooth/$IMAGE_NAME:latest
  #+END_SRC

  - Reboot again to complete the installation:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  systemctl reboot
  #+END_SRC

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.

+ note that $IMAGE_NAME should be replaced with the desired image. i.e., =bluetile= or =bluegnome=.

* Verification

These images are signed with [[https://www.sigstore.dev/]]'s [[https://github.com/sigstore/cosign]].

You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/rvsmooth/bluegnome/template
#+END_SRC
